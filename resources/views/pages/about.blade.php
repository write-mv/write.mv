                    The main goal of <a class="underline" href="https://write.mv"><mark>Write.mv</mark></a> is to give anyone a space on the web to freely share their stories & knowledge online without the need for any technical knowledge to set up their own blog.
                    This isn't limited to writing only a blog post. You can write anything you want to.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">
                    Another reason we decided to create this project is to give Dhivehi writers a place to share their stories. Since there aren't many writing tools online that are optimized for Dhivehi
                    it was quite difficult to post in Dhivehi with the right formatting, fonts intact.  
                 </p>

                 <p class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">
                   We hope that this will help writers to share their journals,publication & stories with people.
